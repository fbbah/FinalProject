    <h1> Prescription Drug Abuse</h1>

    <h1>What is Prescription Drug Abuse</h1>
<section>
    <p>Prescription drug abuse is when someone uses medication in a way that is not intended by a doctor. This can include taking someone else's medicine, using more than the prescribed amount, or taking it to feel a different effect, like getting high. This misuse can be very dangerous and lead to health problems, addiction, or even death. It's important to use prescription drugs only as directed by a healthcare professional to stay safe and healthy.</p>

    <h1> SYMTOMS OF PRESCRIPTIONS DRUG ABUSE </h1>

    <h2>Physical Symptoms:</h2>

    <p>Changes in appetite or weight
    Unusual body odors</p>

    <p>Drowsiness
    Extreme fatigue
    Slurred speech
    Poor coordination</p>
    
    <h2>Psychological Symptoms:</h2>

    <p>Mood swings 
    Increased irritability
    Anxiety or paranoia</p>

    <p>Depression
        Confusion 
       Difficulty concentrating</p>

    <h2>Behavioral Symptoms:</h2>

       <p>Frequent requests for refills before the prescription is due
        "Doctor shopping" (visiting multiple doctors to obtain more prescriptions)</p>
        
        <p>Changes in social behavior, such as withdrawing from friends and family
            Engaging in risky behaviors</p>

        <h3>If you notice these signs in yourself or someone else, it's important to seek help from a healthcare professional.</h3>

        <h1>Why is it on the Rise?</h1>

        <p>The rise in prescription drug abuse is influenced by several factors, including increased availability and prescription rates due to overprescription and aggressive marketing by pharmaceutical companies, which have made these drugs more accessible. Many people perceive prescription drugs as safer than illegal drugs, leading to misuse driven by misconceptions and lack of awareness about their addictive potential.</p>
        <p>Economic factors, like limited access to healthcare, and the presence of unused medications in households further exacerbate the issue. Inadequate monitoring and regulation, despite the implementation of Prescription Monitoring Programs (PMPs), allow for practices like "doctor shopping."</p>
        <p>Mental health issues also play a significant role, with individuals self-medicating for conditions like anxiety, depression, or chronic pain. Social and cultural factors, such as the social acceptance of prescription drug misuse and peer pressure, particularly among teenagers and young adults, contribute to the problem.</p>

    <h2>What is the most common prescription drug abuse?</h2>

    <p>The most commonly abused prescription is Opioids.

        Opioids are typically prescribed for pain relief. Commonly abused opioids include oxycodone (OxyContin), hydrocodone (Vicodin), and morphine.
        
        They produce euphoria by increasing dopamine levels in the brain, which can lead to misuse. Tolerance builds quickly, requiring higher doses and increasing addiction risk. 
        
        Physical dependence can also lead to withdrawal symptoms if usage is reduced or stopped. Misuse occurs when people take higher doses than prescribed, use someone else's medication, or seek the drug for non-medical reasons.

    <h2>Other Commonly Abused Prescription Drugs and the Surge in Overdose Hospitalizations</h2>
    
    <p>Other most commonly abused prescription drugs are..

        Central Nervous System (CNS) Depressants: These are prescribed for anxiety and sleep disorders. Commonly abused CNS depressants include benzodiazepines like alprazolam (Xanax) and diazepam (Valium), as well as sleep medications like zolpidem (Ambien).
        
        
        Stimulants: These are prescribed for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and certain sleep disorders. Commonly abused stimulants include amphetamine (Adderall) and methylphenidate (Ritalin).
        
        For example, take a look at table 2 below, it shows the amount hospital entries alone from drug overdoses.</p>

    <p>The table shows how often different drugs like opioids, stimulants, and cannabis caused overdoses in emergency rooms and hospitals for different ages and times. It gives percentages to show how common these overdoses are each month and year.</p>
   
   <h1>How does it differ between races?</h1>

   <p>To understand how drug abuse differs between races, it is essential to examine various factors influencing these disparities. Prescription drug abuse, in particular, can vary significantly among racial and ethnic groups due to differences in healthcare access, socioeconomic conditions, systemic biases, and cultural attitudes towards drug use. By analyzing data on prescription drug abuse rates across different racial groups, we can uncover patterns and trends that highlight these disparities. This examination helps in identifying specific challenges faced by each group and informs targeted interventions and policies to address the issue more effectively.</p>

    <p>The table reveals that Black/African American groups have the highest overdose death rates, while Asian/Pacific Islander groups have the lowest. Rates for other groups also vary from 2020 to 2022.</p>
    
    <h1>Some are Unintentional..</h1>
    <p>It can be in several different ways.

        Medication Misuse: Taking higher doses or using medications more frequently than prescribed due to misunderstanding instructions.
        
        Lack of Awareness: Not knowing about the addictive potential of certain medications.
        
        Drug Interactions: Harmful effects from combining medications without realizing the risks.
        
        Sharing Medications: Giving prescriptions to others, leading to misuse.
        
        Gradual Dependence: Developing a physical dependence over time without realizing it.
        
        Miscommunication: Poor communication with healthcare providers about proper medication use.</p>
